Movie and Book Search Site

Allows you to search for movies or books and then shows you related books or movies depending on what you've searched for.

When I search for a movie then I am given a list of movies matching my search
When I select a movie from the search results then I am given a list of books that match that movie if they exist.

When I see a movie or book I am able to add it to my watch or read list

When I leave and come back to the site my read/watch list is still there
